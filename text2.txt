The name India is derived from Indus, which originates from the
 Old Persian word Hindush, equivalent to the Sanskrit word Sindhu,
 which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River.
 The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates
 as "The people of the Indus".[23]
